/**
 * What a new session starts with, remembered between launches.
 *
 * Deliberately not in the event log: the log records what happened in a
 * conversation, and a preference is neither an event nor something you would
 * want replayed. A small JSON file is the honest shape for it.
 *
 * Everything here is a *default*, never a constraint — each session still
 * chooses its own agents, directory and profile when it starts. That is what
 * keeps this file safe to lose.
 *
 * Zoom is deliberately **not** here. It is a per-launch adjustment, not a
 * preference: the app opens at 100% every time, and a size you set to read one
 * long diff should not be waiting for you tomorrow. An older file may still
 * carry a `scale` key; the schema drops it on the next read.
